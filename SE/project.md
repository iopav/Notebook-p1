analyze  risk by:   Analyzing the probability that the related hazards will actually cause any damage  ,Analyzing how severe will be for you if the risk actually becomes a problem   

write a description of your reasoning, as detailed as possible  so the reader can understand why you think some hazards are more possible than others  and why some risks are more dangerous than others. 

When a hazard is referenced, it will be within brackets. For instance, hazard number 1 and 2 will be: (1) and (2).

After you have described all the possible risks, then you can prioritize them and provide some  avoidance and contingency plans. In order words, you will describe what concrete actions  your team will make to:  • Make sure the probability of the risk is minimal – what you will do pre-emptive.  • Reduce the effect of the risk if it happens – how you will react. 

The risk of the team losing balance is a serious one, as it can affect the cohesion, collaboration, and performance of the team. The following is an analysis of this risk and its related hazards:

- The probability of some team members getting sick (1) is moderate, as it depends on various factors such as their health condition, exposure to viruses, and stress level. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can reduce the productivity and availability of the affected members, and disrupt the balance and harmony of the team.
- The probability of all team members not having a clear role / clear responsibilities (2) is low, as the team has defined and assigned the roles and responsibilities of each member based on their skills and preferences. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can lead to confusion, duplication, or omission of tasks in the project, and affect the balance and efficiency of the team.
- The probability of the team failing to hand in a deliverable before the deadline (3) is high, as the project has a tight schedule and a lot of dependencies among the tasks. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can affect the quality and compliance of the deliverable, and the grades of the students, and cause frustration and dissatisfaction among the team members.
- The probability of the team buying multiple products from other teams (4) is low, as the team has conducted a thorough market research and feasibility analysis to select the best products that meet their needs and budget. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be managed by negotiating and documenting the contracts with the other teams, and testing and integrating the products properly.
- The probability of another team claiming that the team does not meet requirements agreed upon in a contract (5) is low, as the team has negotiated and documented the contract terms and conditions with the other team, and has adhered to them faithfully. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can cause disputes and delays in the project, but it can be resolved by referring to the contract and seeking external arbitration if needed.
- The probability of the team giving access to the code to another team before receiving a transaction (6) is very low, as the team has followed a secure and reliable payment system to exchange their code with other teams. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can cause a loss of intellectual property and competitive advantage in the project.

The following table summarizes the risk assessment and provides some avoidance and contingency plans for each risk:

| Risk                    | Probability | Severity | Avoidance Plan                                               | Contingency Plan                                             |
| :---------------------- | :---------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| The team loses balance. | High        | Serious  | - Maintain a healthy lifestyle and take preventive measures against illnesses. - Clarify and communicate the roles and responsibilities of each member regularly. - Plan and monitor the project schedule carefully. - Estimate and allocate the resources and effort realistically. - Divide and delegate the tasks efficiently. - Communicate and coordinate effectively. - Apply good software engineering practices and tools. - Conduct a thorough market research and feasibility analysis before buying any products from other teams. - Negotiate and document the contracts with other teams clearly. - Follow a secure and reliable payment system to exchange code with other teams. | - Provide support and assistance to any sick members. - Adjust the workload and responsibilities according to each member’s condition. - Negotiate and request for more time or resources if possible. - Seek help or advice from course staff or other sources if needed. - Compromise on some quality attributes if necessary. - Document and report any issues or deviations from the plan. - Test and integrate the products from other teams properly. - Refer to the contracts and seek external arbitration if needed. - Protect and backup your code regularly. |

intro for D4

1 2 3 5





```
The introduction of the document should summarize, in your own words, what are the Top
4 most critical risks for the completion of the project.
1. Not delivering DF on time.
2. Finishing the project with a negative balance (Uppsalines).
3. Failing the project. 
4. Not passing one or more of the deliverables.



analysis:
for 1:
The related hazards are mostly related to how well our group works together and how accurately we estimate the complexity and of the demanded time of the deliverables. Since the group is at this point already used to working together and have somewhat established routines for how we do work on this project, the hazards directly related to communication and planning (1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11) are unlikely to occur. However, if they do occur the team is well prepared for them, as there already is an established contract about group responsibilities and meeting attendance. So if, for instance, a team member gets busy with other courses (9) they would still, at a minimum, attend all meetings and fulfill their responsibilities as outlined in the group contract. Therefore, the damage caused by this could lead to a delay in finishing DF, but the damage would be reduced by our group contract. The same logic can be applied to (6), (7), and (8) as well. The probability of (9) happening would be medium-high, since most courses will be nearing their end and many students will want to prepare for their final exams, pushing this course aside. Because the team is by now used to working together and have established routines of how we work, (6), (7) and (8) have a low-medium probability of happening as they have happened before, but the team has learned from it and will take efforts to mitigate the chances of it happening again. These efforts can, for example, be having more meetings, using the kanban board properly, and focusing more on the quality of the deliverables before hand-in so that there will not be as many fixes carried out after feedback (when exams in other courses are closer).

The other hazards (2, 3, 17, 26, 27) are more related to the team’s actual abilities when it comes to working on the deliverables. So far during the project, the team has not had any major problems understanding requirements (27), so based on the team’s ability to complete previous deliverables the chance of (27) occurring is low. However, if (27) did occur it would likely cause some delay in delivering DF, as the team would first have to fix all the misinterpretations from deliverables before submitting DF. For (2) and (3), since the integration is not part of any deliverable and only planned for, lacking technical expertise or proper planning would perhaps make D5 take slightly longer to do, but probably only cause minor delay to DF. So far, our team is well balanced with team members having skills in all different parts of the project, so the chance of (2) and (3) occurring is low. And if they were to occur, the risk would not be very severe. The best way to mitigate these is making sure that team members put work into the parts of the project which they feel the most comfortable with. For instance, a team member who is a more experienced software developer may focus more on the technicalities surrounding the integration, while someone more comfortable with planning may focus more on the administrative side of the project.

Overall, the chance of the team not delivering DF on time is very low. That is because of the low chances for the above-mentioned hazards to occur, and the fact that the team has so far not missed a deadline. The team will also take actions to mitigate the severity and chance of the hazards occuring.


for 2:
Since the team consists of members that are all communicating well and are ambitious with receiving a high grade, the probability of this risk is low. However, it is still possible that it can happen due to hazards occurring. For instance, if a team member gets sick (1) then that might cause a time plan to not work out, which in turn can lead to the team not being able to finish a deliverable on time and losing Uppsalines. This hazard has a very high probability, and has already happened on multiple occasions during the project. Other hazards that also can cause a time plan to not work out is underestimating the complexity of the integration (2), the team members being busy with other courses (9), disagreements between team members (11), leading to more work than initially planned. The probability for this hazard is low, since the team has done thorough research on the AI component they have bought from another team and believe that they have a clear view of how complex the integration would be. If however, the integration would be more complex that initially estimated, then the severity of the hazard would be quite low since the team is prepared to put more time on the project if needed. 

If the communication between the team members is lacking (6), it may cause important things being missed or misinterpreted, such as handing in a deliverable. Both the probability and the severity of this hazard is high as it has occurred in the project with handing in a resubmission for D2. The team has stated in the first Scrum Retrospective that members of the team may interpret things differently, but the team is working on being more clear and meticulous with making sure that everyone has the same understanding of things discussed, so the probability may be reduced in the future. The severity of missing a deadline for a hand in is high since that causes the team to lose Uppsalines. Other hazards that can cause the team to lose currency are failing to hand in deliverables on time (17), accidentally buying multiple products from other groups (19), and losing a contract because another team claims we do not meet the agreements (25). The hazard of failing to hand in a deliverable on time depends a lot on other hazards, and can therefore be considered a risk itself, but it is also a hazard that causes the team to lose Uppsalines and possibly ending up with a negative currency. Therefore the severity is high, and the probability is medium since there are many things that can lead up to it but they require quite large mistakes to occur without the team being able to manage it. Accidentally buying multiple products from other groups has a very low probability to occur, since it requires team members to act by themselves and not communicate to the other members what they are doing, but the severity will be high since it causes the team to lose at least 80 Uppsalines. Losing a contract is medium severity because it causes the team to lose at least 80 potential Uppsalines. The probability of this occurring is medium, since it is slightly out of the team’s control if the other team decides that they no longer want the product if it does not have to do with the quality of the team’s product. 

When it comes to losing a deliverable (29), the severity is medium since it depends on the size of the deliverable and how much the team remembers of it. The probability for this occurring is low, since it is not very probable that a member deletes a document, and it is not able to be restored. Finally, giving access to the code to another team before receiving payment for it (30) can have a high severity depending on the person receiving it. If the person is honest, they will fulfill the agreement but in the unlikely case that the person “scams” the team, that means a loss of at least 80 Uppsalines. For this, the severity can be considered medium and the probability can be considered very low since the team follows the principle of receiving a payment before giving access to the code.

The risk of finishing the project with a negative balance of Uppsalines has a low probability of occurring because of the ambitious team members, but the severity is high since it may cause the members to fail the course.


for 3:
For the project to fail, many unmanageable mistakes must occur. There are some hazards which can cause the mistakes to occur. For instance, poor communication between team members (6) can lead to loss of Uppsalines because of bad investments or missing deadlines. As described in Risk 2, the probability and the severity of this is high. If the team members get busy with other courses (9), that can lead to more time needing to be spent on the course by other members, which could be manageable but not fair. However, if multiple people from the team are not able to work on the project due to being busy with other courses, that can lead to not being able to complete the project or deliverables on time, which is a high severity. The probability is medium, since it highly depends on what the other courses require from the team members as well as what the team members choose to prioritize. The hazard of failing to hand in a deliverable before deadline (17) can occur because of poor communication and the members being busy with other courses, and that itself has a high severity since it causes a loss of Uppsalines and that can ultimately lead to failing the project. However, the probability is medium, since it depends on many other quite non-probable things. 

Failing to meet the requirements on a deliverable (23) and misinterpreting the instructions of a deliverable (27) has both a medium probability of occurring as well as a medium severity. This is because it is normal to misinterpret instructions regarding things that you are learning. It can be considered quite difficult to know what is expected regarding things you do not fully understand yet, which is the case of the deliverables. However, more often the team thinks that the requirements of the deliverable are passed but not the high grade that was hoped for. The severity is medium since the team is given another chance but it also causes the team to need to put more time than planned on fixing the requirements. It is not definite that it will harm the project to the point of it failing however. If the team were to lose the code of the project (28), that would mean a very high severity since it would cause a huge loss of progress and will stop the team from finishing deliverables which are depending on the code. The probability is however very low, thanks to it being saved on GitHub as well as several of the team’s local computers. When it comes to losing a deliverable (29), the probability is slightly higher, but the severity is most likely lower. Finally, if the game platform does not meet the client’s requirements (32) the project could fail if it is unfixable. However, since the course provides some safety to prevent this from happening, the severity is reduced to medium. The probability is very low, since the team already has had an elicitation with the client where the client stated that they were satisfied with the current state of the product, and therefore this hazard is very unlikely to occur.

The risk of failing the project has a very high severity since it causes the members to fail the course, but the probability of it happening is low thanks to the ambitious team members.

for 4:

Since all the members of the group want to have a good grade on this course, and are all working for this project, I think the possibility of not passing one or more of the deliverables is quite low. However the possibility still exists even if it’s not so high, due to some unresistible reasons.

Everyone in the team should devote their time and effort to work for the deliverables, but there could be some reason we can’t foresee, like team members could get sick(1). Or if team members being busy with other courses(9).All these situations would possibly cause the absence of the certain team member in the team work, causing the enlargement of the  workload of other members. Then these could eventually result in the delay of the deliverables or low quality completion of the deliverables. But actually if these two situations happen, team members could reasonably negotiate and adjust work tasks to make up for the possible impact on the workload of vacancies. I think the probability of these two hazards could cause the failure of the deliverable is quite low.

Working as a team, it is very important for the team to have good communication. What’s more, members should have the ability to negotiate with others,resolve conflicts and disagreements. So all these hazards as follows could result in a bad teamwork which results in a bad outcome. Poor communication between team members(6),disagreements/conflicts between team members(11).These hazards are mainly about teamwork,and the probability of them actually causing the failure of the deliverable is low. Even team members could have different personalities, no one wants to fail a group project then fail the course I suppose. Even if so, the rest of the team members can report this problem to the teachers or in the scrum retrospective, which has a high probability that it can be solved. 

Team members should also have a clear interpretation of their roles,responsibilities and the consistent goal of the whole team,as well as what they should do in every different phase of the work to make better deliverables. If team members are not reviewing each other’s work enough(10), there could be big differences between each member’s work,which results in the conflicts in the deliverables. The probability of this hazard to actually happen and result in a failure for the deliverable is high, since the whole deliverable is big, and other team members may not have that much time and patience.

Since D5 is about the integration of two components and one of them needs to buy from another group with uppsalines. If the team does not have enough uppsalines to purchase the AI component(20), the team can’t complete the D5 which of course results in the failure of the deliverable. But since every team starts with 100 uppsalines and the cost of the component is normally 80, and there are a few ways to get bonus for the uppsalines for example 80% of the team members attending the activity can get bonus, the probability of one team do not have enough uppsalines to purchase a component is quite low.

Other hazards related to the integration, team members have different interpretations of the requirements of the integration(13), the bought software lacks proper documentation(15) and the purchased system’s functional requirements are hard to find measures for(26). All these could directly result in the failure of D5. However, since the instructions of D5 are clear, the probability of 13 actually happening in real life is low. And as for 15 and 26, deciding which components to buy should be based on the reading of the shared d3, so choosing the suitable component is the responsibility of the group. So I think the probability of 15 and 26 to actually cause some damage is low.

The team fails to meet the requirements on the deliverables(23) and the team misinterprets the instructions/requirements of a deliverable(27). I believe as the team works hard on the project, it is impossible that the team will fail on the deliverable due to these two hazards, as I said the instructions of the deliverable are quite clear and all the team members should have a basic ability to understand. There could be some misunderstanding or some requirements are not met, but they can’t result in a failure if the team members work hard and do not want to fail. Therefore, I think the probability of these hazards could actually causing damage is low.






To summarize what actions will you be taking as a group to minimize 
the probability that those 4 risks will ever happen.

solution:
for 1:
Making sure there is a time plan for deliverables with some leeway in case something goes wrong.

Check the Kanban board every meeting to make sure it is used properly. 

Focus on improving the quality of the previous deliverables by handing in multiple times and fixing according to feedback.


for 2:
Making sure there is a time plan for deliverables with some leeway in case something goes wrong.

Having good and consistent communication within the team and not making decisions individually.

If the team has a negative balance, discuss with Davide on how to compensate.

for 3:
Making sure there is a time plan for deliverables with some leeway in case something goes wrong.

Having good communication within the team and with the client, and not making decisions individually.

Handing in the deliverables multiple times to get feedback on what needs to be fixed to pass them.

Have meetings with the client to make sure that the requirements are met.

If the team is failing something, discuss with Davide on how to compensate and make up for it.

for 4:
For avoiding this risk, the team should read the requirements and instructions of the deliverable carefully. And of course the team members should know their responsibilities and the individual tasks for the deliverables. 

If the team fails on the deliverables, they should prioritize this course in the first place, and improve their deliverables based on the feedback from the TA.

This document outlines the risks which might lead to failure of the whole project.

The top 4 risks are:

1. Not delivering DF on time.
2. Finishing the project with a negative balance (Uppsalines).
3. Failing the project. 
4. Not passing one or more of the deliverables.

for risk1 , not delivering DF on time, we assumed that






The risk of the team members needing to spend more time on the project than planned is a serious one, as it can affect the quality of the final product, the satisfaction of the stakeholders, and the grades of the students.

The probability of some team members getting sick (1) is moderate, as it depends on various factors such as their health condition, exposure to viruses, and stress level. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can reduce the productivity and availability of the affected members, and put more pressure on the rest of the team.
The probability of underestimating the complexity of the integration between the two software systems (2) is high, as it is a common challenge in software engineering projects. The severity of this hazard is also high, as it can cause delays, errors, and rework in the development process.
The probability of tests lacking (3) is high, as the team has planned to conduct various types of testing throughout the project, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can affect the quality and reliability of the software, but it can be mitigated by applying good testing practices and tools.
The probability of poor communication between team members (4) is low, as the team has established regular meetings, online chats, and documentation tools to facilitate communication and collaboration. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and inconsistencies in the project.
The probability of the distribution of work not being equivalent between team members (5) is low, as the team has agreed on a fair and balanced allocation of tasks and responsibilities based on their skills and preferences. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be resolved by adjusting the workload and providing feedback and support to each other.
The probability of team members getting busy with other courses (6) is high, as they have to balance their time and effort among different academic obligations. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can affect their motivation and performance in the project, but it can be managed by prioritizing and scheduling their tasks effectively.
The probability of not reviewing each other’s work enough (7) is medium, as the team has planned to conduct peer reviews and inspections regularly to ensure the quality and consistency of the project deliverables. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be improved by applying good review practices and tools.
The probability of disagreements/conflicts between team members (8) is low, as the team has established a positive and respectful working environment where they can communicate openly and constructively. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be resolved by applying conflict management techniques and seeking external help if needed.
The probability of team members having different aspirations for the quality of the final product (9) is low, as the team has agreed on a common vision and goal for the project that meets the expectations and requirements of the stakeholders. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be aligned by discussing and compromising on the trade-offs between quality attributes such as functionality, usability, reliability, performance, maintainability, etc.
The probability of the bought software lacking proper documentation (10) is low, as the team has chosen a reputable and reliable software vendor that provides comprehensive and updated documentation for their product. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be overcome by contacting the vendor’s customer support or consulting other sources of information such as online forums or tutorials.
The probability of there being a bug in the developed software (11) is high, as it is inevitable that some defects will occur during the software development process. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can affect the functionality and reliability of the software, but it can be detected and corrected by applying good debugging practices and tools.
The probability of a team member quitting the course (12) is very low, as they have invested a lot of time and effort in the project and have a strong commitment to complete it successfully. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can disrupt the progress and continuity of the project and put more burden on the remaining team members.
The probability of the team failing to meet the requirements on the deliverables (13) is low, as the team has followed an agile and iterative approach to elicit, analyze, specify, validate, and manage the requirements throughout the project. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can affect the quality and acceptance of the final product, and the grades of the students.
The probability of the team doing double work (14) is low, as the team has used a version control system to manage their code and documents, and has communicated clearly about their tasks and progress. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be avoided by checking and merging the changes regularly.
The probability of another team claiming that the team does not meet requirements agreed upon in a contract (15) is low, as the team has negotiated and documented the contract terms and conditions with the other team, and has adhered to them faithfully. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can cause disputes and delays in the project, but it can be resolved by referring to the contract and seeking external arbitration if needed.
The probability of the purchased system’s functional requirements being hard to find measures for (16) is low, as the team has defined clear and measurable criteria to evaluate the functionality of the system, such as input/output, accuracy, completeness, consistency, etc. The severity of this hazard is low, as it can be addressed by applying good measurement practices and tools.
The probability of the team misinterpreting the instructions/requirements of a deliverable (17) is low, as the team has read and understood the instructions/requirements carefully, and has asked for clarification or feedback from the course staff if needed. The severity of this hazard is medium, as it can affect the quality and compliance of the deliverable, but it can be corrected by revising and resubmitting the deliverable if possible.
The probability of the team losing the developed code  and a deliverable (18)(19) is very low, as the team has used a version control system to backup their code regularly, and has stored their code in multiple locations such as local machines, cloud services, or external drives. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can cause a significant loss of work and time in the project.
The probability of the game platform not meeting the requirements set by the client (20) is low, as the team has conducted a thorough market research and feasibility analysis to select a suitable game platform that meets the needs and preferences of the client. The severity of this hazard is high, as it can affect the satisfaction and acceptance of the client, and the success of the project.
