Dear Marina,

We appreciate your interest in discussing potential business opportunities with our software company.

We are certainly intrigued by your idea of creating a fun and comprehensive game platform tailored for CS students, designed to be played on a single computer via a terminal.

To move forward and delve into the details of this opportunity, we would like to schedule a meeting with you. 

We look forward to the opportunity to discuss how our software company can collaborate with VegaSoft on this exciting project.

Best regards,
