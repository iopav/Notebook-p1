#### Questions

1. Considerations relevant when doing an ethical assessment of Sci-Hub:

   - Copyright infringement
   - Access to knowledge
   - Funding of scientific research and publishing
   - Quality and reliability of research
   - Legal implications and compliance
   - Global equity in access to information
   - Role of open access movements

2. Why these considerations are relevant:

   - These factors raise ethical questions about intellectual property rights, equal access to knowledge, financial sustainability of research publishing, research quality, legal boundaries, global disparities, and the evolving norms in scholarly communication.

3. Relevant stakeholders and their interests:
   - Publishers (safeguarding copyright, financial sustainability)
   - Researchers (access to information, research quality)
   - Authors (copyright protection, recognition)
   - Students (affordable access to knowledge)
   - Institutions (research funding, reputation)
   - Legal entities (enforcement of copyright laws)
   - Advocates for open access (free knowledge dissemination)

   public wants to access to research output
   
4. Why these stakeholders are relevant:

   - Gains and outputs form a food chain in academic ecology

   - Their interests shape the ethical dimensions of Sci-Hub's existence and usage, encompassing copyright, knowledge access, research quality, legal compliance, funding, and scholarly communication.

5. Arguments for and against Sci-Hub's existence:

   **For Sci-Hub:**

   - Equitable access to knowledge for all, regardless of financial status.
   - Accelerates scientific progress by eliminating paywalls and barriers.
   - Bridges the global knowledge divide, fostering international collaboration.

   make a deal for lib

   **Against Sci-Hub:**

   - Copyright infringement and financial harm to publishers.
   - Undermines the peer-review process, risking research quality.
   - Sets a precedent for disregarding copyright law in the digital age.

   peer reviewing quality

6. Balancing interests between different stakeholders:
   - Promote open access models to make research widely available while respecting copyright.
   - Encourage publishers to adopt sustainable pricing models and support initiatives for affordable access.
   - Strengthen copyright laws while considering exceptions for educational and research purposes.
   - Support alternative peer-review models that maintain research quality.

7. Legalizing distribution of copyrighted scientific articles like Sci-Hub and its effects on stakeholders:

   Legalization Argument:
   - Equitable access to knowledge becomes a legal right, enhancing global education and research.
   - Researchers benefit from expanded access to relevant literature, accelerating their work.
   - Scientific progress and innovation are stimulated by unrestricted sharing of information.

   Effects on Stakeholders:
   - Positive impact on researchers, students, and institutions through improved access.
   - Publishers might adapt to open access models, potentially affecting revenue streams.
   - Authors could gain wider recognition as their work reaches a larger audience.
   - Legal authorities would need to oversee the distribution to ensure ethical compliance.

   Balancing:
   - Enforce proper regulations to prevent abuse of copyrighted material.
   - Establish mechanisms for compensating authors and publishers for the wider access to their work.
   - Collaborate with publishers and open access advocates to find sustainable solutions.

In this scenario, legalizing distribution as Sci-Hub does could address knowledge disparities, but it would require careful consideration of copyright, financial sustainability, and mechanisms to balance the interests of stakeholders involved.

```
How does Sci-Hub ensure the quality and validity of the data it provides? Does Sci-Hub have any mechanisms to detect and correct errors, frauds or retractions in the scientific papers it hosts? How does Sci-Hub deal with the ethical issues of plagiarism, authorship and citation in the data it disseminates?

```

#### generic drugs

[仿制药]是个通俗的说法，英文是[generic drug](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=generic drug&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra={"sourceType"%3A"answer"%2C"sourceId"%3A852994408})。仿制药与对应的原研药（RLD，Reference Listed Drug）在活性药物成分（API，Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient）、剂型、规格上是一致的。但配方未必一致

我有一个可能会相关的想法，关于sci-hub与仿制药的联系。

- sci-hub在印度的案例与仿制药在印度的案例的相同点是：
  - 都涉及到印度对科学文献和药品的专利保护的问题，以及印度政府和法院如何平衡国际规则和国内利益的问题。
  - 都引起了国际社会的关注和争议，尤其是西方发达国家和跨国出版商或药企，他们认为印度侵犯了他们的知识产权，并要求印度加强专利保护和执行力度。
  - 都受到了印度国内和全球的支持和声援，包括科学家、医生、政策顾问、非政府组织等，他们认为印度的做法有利于促进科学研究和公共健康，为发展中国家提供了低价的文献和药物。
- sci-hub在印度的案例与仿制药在印度的案例的不同点是：
  - sci-hub是一个网站，它通过非法获取付费内容并免费提供给用户，而仿制药是一种产品，它通过逆向工程或其他方法复制原研药并以低价销售。
  - sci-hub是首次在法庭上为自己辩护，基于2012年德里大学教材复制案。
  - sci-hub作为一种虚拟主体，药品为实体主体，它是一种更为模糊的存在，它的道德边界并不像药品那么分明。所以这里还有很长的路要走。但我认为在数据日益重要的当代，数据流动的凝滞是一种慢性疾病，仿制药是治疗方法的一种预习。我们会打破这种壁垒，one way or another, 就像打破贸易壁垒一样。

如何改善科技不发达地区的困境，这是一个复杂而又重要的问题。我认为可能有以下一些方面可以考虑：

- 增加科技不发达地区的科研投入和人才培养，提高其自主创新能力和核心竞争力。
- 建立科技不发达地区之间的合作机制和交流平台，共享资源和经验，促进区域一体化和发展。
- 推动科技发达地区对科技不发达地区的支持和帮助，包括技术转让、知识共享、资金援助等。
- 倡导科技发达地区对科技不发达地区的尊重和理解，避免单方面强加规则或利用优势地位进行不公平竞争。
- 保护科技不发达地区的合法权益，维护其参与全球科技治理和决策的话语权。

胜利将表明'事实'只是一种意见

Victory will show the ‘fact’ to be merely an opinion



weigh the pros and cons

This brings me to the case of generics.

I have an idea that might be relevant, about the connection between sci-hub and generic drugs.

```
A generic drug is a medicine that has the same active ingredient and the same effects as a brand-name drug, but it is usually cheaper and sold under a different name.
```



- similarities :
  - Both involve the issue of India’s patent protection for papers and drugs, and the Indian government and courts found an interesting way to balance international rules and domestic interests. which is <u>*exemptions in India’s Copyright Act of 1957.*</u>
  
    ```
    Indian compulsory license is a legal authorization granted by the Indian Patent Office to a third party to use a patented invention without the consent of the patent owner, under certain conditions. The main purpose of compulsory license is to prevent the misuse of patent rights by the patent owner and to ensure the availability of affordable and accessible medicines for the public. 
    ```
  
    
  
  - Both have attracted the attention and controversy of the international community, especially the academic giants and multinational publishers or pharma<u>ceu</u>tical (su) companies, who believe that India has violated their intellectual property rights and demand India to strengthen patent protection and enforcement.
  
  - Both have received support and solidarity from within India and globally, including scientists, doctors, policy advisers, non-governmental organizations, etc., who believe that India’s actions are conducive to promoting scientific research and public health, and provide low-cost literature and drugs for developing countries.
- differences :
  - Sci-hub is a website that obtains paid content illegally and provides it to users for free, while generic drugs are a product that replicates original drugs by reverse engineering or other methods and sells them at a low price.
  - Sci-hub is defending itself in court for the first time, based on the 2012 Delhi University textbook copying case.
  - Sci-hub is a virtual entity, while drugs are a physical entity. It is a more ambiguous existence, and its moral boundaries are not as clear as drugs. So there is still a long way to go. But I think that in the contemporary era where data is increasingly important, data stagnation is a chronic disease, and generic drugs are a preview/rehearsal of the treatment method. We will break this barrier, one way or another, just like breaking trade barriers.

How to improve the plight of technologically underdeveloped areas is a complex and important issue. I think there may be some aspects to consider:

- Increase scientific research investment and talent cultivation in technologically underdeveloped areas, and improve their independent innovation ability and core competitiveness.
- Establish cooperation mechanisms and exchange platforms among technologically underdeveloped areas, share resources and experiences, and promote regional integration and development.
- Promote the support and help of technologically developed areas to technologically underdeveloped areas, including technology transfer, knowledge sharing, financial assistance, etc.
- Advocate respect and understanding of technologically underdeveloped areas by technologically developed areas, avoid imposing rules unilaterally or using advantageous positions for unfair competition.
- Protect the legitimate rights and interests of technologically underdeveloped areas, and maintain their voice in global science and technology governance and decision-making.

#### carbon emission zoning

```
different regions according to their carbon emission characteristics and emission reduction targets, so as to achieve inter-regional coordination and optimisation of carbon emission reduction
```

- Is it possible to partition academic output in the same way that carbon emissions are partitioned? 
- The two are different in terms of rights and obligations.
- Steam pricing is based on different countries.

#### thief steal

Despite being on the opposite side of the law, Sci-Hub is a tool that countless researchers rely on.

Sci-hub是一个提供免费学术论文下载的网站，它通过突破期刊的付费墙，获取了数千万篇受版权保护的文章，并向公众免费开放。Sci-hub的创始人Alexandra Elbakyan是一位哈萨克斯坦的计算机科学家，她认为科学知识应该是全人类的共同财富，而不是某些学术出版商的私有财产。

Sci-hub是否是学术窃贼，这是一个有争议的问题。一方面，学术出版商指责Sci-hub侵犯了他们的版权和利益，威胁了学术质量和安全，甚至将其称为“学术海盗”。他们在多个国家对Sci-hub提起了法律诉讼，试图关闭其网站和镜像。另一方面，许多科研工作者和学生支持Sci-hub的行为，认为它为他们提供了平等和便捷地获取学术资源的机会，促进了知识的传播和创新。他们认为学术出版商的收费过高，垄断了知识市场，剥削了科研者的劳动成果。

从语义上讲，偷走意味着原本拥有者失去了某物。但Sci-hub并没有使原本拥有者失去他们的知识，而只是复制了他们的知识，并将其分享给更多的人。因此，用偷是不合适的词汇。或许，用共享、传播、开放等词汇更能反映Sci-hub的真实性质。

Semantically, stealing implies that the original owner loses something. But Sci-hub does not cause the original owner to lose their knowledge, but merely copies it and shares it with more people. Therefore, stealing is not the right word to use. Perhaps the true nature of Sci-hub is better reflected by using terms such as sharing, dissemination, and openness.

最后，我想引用一句亚伦·斯沃茨（Aaron Swartz）的名言：“信息自由流动。” 他是一位互联网先驱和社会活动家，曾经为开源知识而奋斗，并因此遭到美国政府和学术出版商的迫害而自杀身亡。 他的故事也许可以给我们一些启示和灵感。

管制者对车内的乘客、路上的行人之间的取舍，有非常复杂的利益关系。此时，无论管制者作出明确决策或者不做这个决策，都实际上构成了管制。让各个汽车公司自己去决定，这也是一种管制的决策。我们希望人们警醒，在管制语境中，各种商业利益和权力可能会伪装成技术、商业和政策上的某种必然性绑架决策过程。防止这一情况发生，需要有好的民主讨论和决策过程。
How do we prevent this from happening in an autonomous driving context? 
The controller has a very complex interest in the trade-off between the passengers in the car and the pedestrians on the road. At this point, whether the controller makes a clear decision or does not make that decision, it effectively constitutes regulation. 
Leaving it to the individual car companies to make their own decisions is also a kind of regulatory decision. We want people to be alerted to the fact that in a regulatory context, 

various commercial interests and powers may kidnap the decision-making process disguised as some sort of technical, commercial and policy inevitability. Preventing this from happening requires good democratic discussion and decision-making processes.


通过绑架流程来操纵决策，这一责任该由谁负？通常没有具体的人来负。或者决策完了没有正当的实施流程。技术是最终的执行者，但执行中可能的细节偏差往往缺乏专业而公正的鉴定，这就把"决策锅"变成了"执行锅"。
技术要不要发展这么快？在没有商业驱动的情况下，他们通常不打补丁。
Who is responsible for the manipulation of decision-making through the kidnapping process? Often there is no specific person to take responsibility. Or there is no proper implementation process after the decision is made. Technology is the ultimate implementer, but the implementation of the possible details of the deviation often lack of professional and impartial identification, which turns the "decision-making pot" into "implementation pot".
Should technology evolve so fast? In the absence of interests drivers, they usually not patched.

```
