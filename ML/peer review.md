### Subset of methods

This paper conducted four different model(Logistic Regression, QDA, K-Neighbor, Random Forest) which satisfied the criteria.

### Tasks in Section 4.2 for each method & Description of the considered methods & Format

Basically completed the task, using different methods such as grid search to select hyperparameters

In 3.1, this section explained the lemma behind logistic regression. In line65, you introduced theta_hat without mentioning it before. The notation is easy to understand, but some simple additional instructions might be better.

The loss function could be elaborated a bit more with a more detailed form.

In line 69, this theta is without hat. The symbols here are a bit confusing, a bit of uniformity would be better

the rest part is great.

for 3.2, My understanding is that both LDA and QDA should be used and evaluated, only QDA is implemented in the text, maybe the LDA part should be added.

The formula for pi should probably be placed earlier to increase coherence.

the rest part is fine.

for 3.3, in line 128 The indentation of the article does not seem to be consistent with neuroips23. If it is a formula, it can be centered.

in line 136, inline formulas should also use conforming formats.

in 138, format problem.

this part included too much format problem.

for 3.4

There are too few explanations about the core idea of random forests. There is only one formula for the Gini coefficient. I think it is not enough to grasp the random forest, so I think this part can add more theoretical explanations and explanations of the iterative process.

### Technical quality of the proposed solution

In essence, the proposed solution not only meets the technical requirements of the task but also goes beyond by providing meaningful insights into the data distribution and potential predictive challenges. The language used is precise, fostering a clear understanding of the proposed solution's technical merits. Overall, the technical quality of the solution is reasonable and sufficient.

### Requirements in Section5.1

This article is well-structured and meets the requirements of 5.1. It has the necessary parts and the references can be more sufficient to improve the credibility of the article.

### Data analysis task

The paper listed different types of features and provided plausible reasons, which I think is correct.

This part is well constructed with sufficient descriptions and explicit figures. Illustrated the different tendency of hour/day/month and weekdays/holidays.

For the weather feature, the paper gave a heatmap, which I think is a great way to illustrate correlation of different weather features and prediction. And you reach a correct answer to the weather related question.

So, I gave full score to this part

### Language

The language used is technical but accessible. It effectively conveys complex information without unnecessary complexity. Sentence structure is clear, aiding in understanding the data characteristics and patterns.
